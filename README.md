# 🎙️ Customer Support Voice Agent

An **AI-powered voice agent** that automates customer support using **Deepgram (STT + TTS)**, **Twilio (telephony)**, **OpenAI (NLP + reasoning)**, and **SQLite (persistent storage)**.  
It can handle **complaint booking, tracking, escalation, reporting, sentiment analysis**, and supports **bilingual conversations (English + Hindi)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Incoming Call** → Managed via **Twilio**  
2. **STT (Speech-to-Text)** → Deepgram converts voice to text  
3. **NLP & Reasoning** → OpenAI model for intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis  
4. **Function Calls** → Complaint operations mapped to SQLite backend  
5. **Database** → Stores customers, complaints, interactions, and metrics  
6. **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** → Deepgram converts text response to natural voice  
7. **Customer** → Hears automated response over call
